# Inferential Statistics

One of the foundational aspects of statistical analysis is inference, or the process of drawing conclusions about a larger population from a sample of data.For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data. Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another).

## Project
Iowa Dataset

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this dataset will help you determine aspects which influence price of a property other than sq.ft. area and locality.
